This R code implements the GSPPCA algorithm for high-dimensional unsupervised feature selection.
The relevant functions are provided in the GSPPCA.R file and a little demo is in the demoGSPPCA.R file

IMPORTANT REMARK: we use the model described in [1] rather than [2]. These models simply differ by the parametrization of alpha.
